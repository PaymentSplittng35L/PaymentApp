## SplitPay App - CS35L Final Project:

### How to Install and Run:

1) By cloning the Git itself

First, go to your terminal and run 

`git clone https://github.com/PaymentSplittng35L/PaymentApp.git`

Then run the following:

`cd PaymentApp`

Once you are in the folder, simply run the following in succession:

`npm install`

`npm start`

This should open the app in your local browser, named localhost:3000. You will then be able to run and experiment with the app; in particular, if you are a new user consider registering for an account / logging in with Google, then creating a new group to add payments to. 

2) By downloading the files

Ensure that you are currently on the "master" branch in the GitHub (should be default if you come to the page for the first time). In order to use our application, begin by clicking the green "<> Code" button, then "Download Zip" to download our project as a zip file. 

The file should be named "PaymentApp-master.zip". Locate this file on your computer, and if not done automatically by your computer, right click and "Extract All" to create a folder containing the files. 

Copy the path of the newly-created folder; you can do this by right-clicking the file and then selecting "Copy as Path" or similar. Now go to your terminal, and enter the command

`cd [FOLDER_PATH]`

where FOLDER_PATH is what you just copied. Now, run the command

`npm install`

to install any necessary dependencies. Finally, run 

`npm start`

to open the app in your local browser, named localhost:3000.
